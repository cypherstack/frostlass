# FROSTLASS 
## Flexible Ring-Oriented Schnorr-like Threshold Linkably Anonymous Signature Scheme

This repo manages the FROSTLASS proposal document. 

FROSTLASS is a thresholdization of the CLSAG signature scheme underlying Monero's Ring Confidential Transactions before migration to full-chain membership proofs. This proposal was written to describe the Rust implementation in /networks/monero/ at commit 48db06f in [this repo](https://github.com/serai-dex/serai/tree/48db06f901952b24bb38d7c7e256f798f08512cd/networks/monero).

See LaTeX code in /src/latex/main.tex and see the compiled pdf in /proposal/frostlass.pdf.
